These are tools for compressing and decompressing files in Sega's "segs" format.

I originally made these for modding the PS3 version of Sonic Unleashed.

Oddly, this file format shares some similarities with the "Moduled Kosinski"
format used by Sonic 3. Probably coincidental.

Currently, these tools incorporate some code from QuickBMS, so they're licensed
under the GPLv2.
